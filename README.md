# pricemonitor-ui AngularJS module skeleton

## Instructions
:warning: Warning: The `lib` and `example` code is compiled separately.

Only once or when dependencies are added:
```bash
yarn
```

To start compiling both `lib` and `example`
```bash
./utils/dev.sh
```
This will start a webserver and show the AngularJS application residing in `example`.

:pencil: It will re-compile on file changes

To build the `lib`
```bash
yarn build:lib
```
